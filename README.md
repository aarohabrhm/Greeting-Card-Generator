# Onam Greeting Card Generator

Why send a boring "Happy Onam" text when you can send a **beautiful, musical, personalized greeting card**?

This project is a **Greeting Card Generator** for Onam. Instead of typing plain messages, you can create and share a **link** that opens a festive card with:

* 🖋️ **Your Name**
* 💌 **Personalized Message**
* 🎶 **Onam Music**

## Features

* 🌼 Generate & share unique **Onam greeting card links**
* 🖊️ Add your **name & message** for personalization
* 🎶 Built-in **Onam music player** (click the button, feel the vibes!)
* 📱 Works on desktop & mobile (because happiness should be cross-platform 💻📱)

## How It Works

1. Open the Greeting Card Generator.
2. Enter your **name** + (optional) **message**.
3. Get a **special shareable link**.
4. Send it to your friends & family.
